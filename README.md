#Object recognition using Keras involves leveraging the power of deep learning to accurately identify and classify objects within images or videos.
#Keras, a popular high-level neural network library, provides a user-friendly interface for building and training deep learning models.
#With Keras, object recognition tasks can be accomplished by employing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that automatically learn and extract meaningful features from the input data.
#These CNN models consist of multiple layers that perform operations such as convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers.
#By training these models on large datasets, they can learn to recognize objects with remarkable accuracy. 
#Object recognition using Keras opens up exciting possibilities in various domains, including computer vision, robotics, autonomous vehicles, and more.
